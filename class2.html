  <font color="#888A85"><p>The vast majority of people tend to believe that the hacker's attitude is limited to the culture of
Software and nothing there is further from the truth. There are people who apply attitude hacker to things
different as electronics or music are - actually, it can be found at the more levels

But you have to be careful; In the dark underground world there is also a transgressive group
who works behind the trenches and noisily called themselves hackers, but they are very
Far from being. These are people (mainly teenage men) who like to break into
Computers and do Phreaking in the telephone system. The true hackers designate these
People with the term of <b>crackers</b> and do not want to be related to them.

True hackers think that most crackers are lazy, irresponsible subjects,
And not very smart. They object that being able to break the security of a system does not become
more hacker than being able to move to the cables of a car to light it does not

erroneously the word 'hacker' to describe the crackers and this is something that irritates them to great
scale.

In Spanish-speaking places, you are known as crack to the best element of a group in a

If you want to know what a true hacker is, he keeps reading. If you want to be a cracker, go read the
news group Alt.2600 and get ready to kick you on the head when you discover that
subjects who are there are not smarter than the legendary donkey who snorted in a
